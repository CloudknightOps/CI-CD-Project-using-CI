# Continous integration and continous Delivery of a Docker packaged Nodejs Web application 
### This is Project is a requirement for my On-going Udacity cloud DevOp Nano degree Programme 
### It is a simple employee Directory Web application built with reactjs (frontend) and Nodejs for it's Backend logic. It features an postgres Database for saving the Credentials of the employees. 
### In this project I demonstrated my indepth knowledge of CICD by building an automated CICD pipeline using CIrcleCI. 
## The built artifact was deployed to a Dev-enviroment on the AWS with the aid of Ansible for configuration management. Then I installed and configured prometheus and alert manager to enhance the monitoring capabilities of my Infrastructure.
