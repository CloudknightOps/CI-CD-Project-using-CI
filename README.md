# Continuous integration and continuous Delivery of a Multi-tier Cloud-native Web application on AWS with Advance Monitoring Capabilities using Prometheus
#### It is a simple employee Directory Web application built with reactjs (frontend) and Nodejs for it's Backend logic. It features an postgres Database for saving the Credentials of the employees. 
#### In this project I demonstrated my indepth knowledge of CICD by building an automated CICD pipeline using CIrcleCI server to build the linted and properly tested code into a docker image(Artifact) from a github Repo.
#### The built artifact was deployed to a Dev-enviroment on the AWS with the aid of Ansible for configuration management. Then I installed and configured prometheus and alert manager to enhance the monitoring capabilities of my Infrastructure.
